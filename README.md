## Features

- Common middlewares for handling various aspects of bot functionality.
- Level-based access control for bot commands.
- Integration with PostgreSQL using Prisma for efficient database operations.
- Language picker and internationalization support for user-friendly interactions.
- Basic encapsulation techniques to enhance code organization and readability.

## Installation and Local Launch

Follow these steps to get the bot up and running locally:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jaskaurhello/telegram-bot-gotd-template.git`
2. Launch a local instance of the [PostgreSQL database](https://postgresapp.com).
3. Start a local Redis server.
4. Create a `.env` file with the required environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).
5. Run `go get -u .` in the root folder of the project.
6. Install Prisma by running: `go get github.com/steebchen/prisma-client-go`
7. Push database schema changes with: `go run github.com/steebchen/prisma-client-go db push`
8. Start the bot with: `make dev`

Once these steps are completed, your bot should be up and running locally, ready for development and testing.

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

- `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token.
- `DATABASE_URL`: URL of the PostgreSQL database.
- `REDIS_URL`: URL of the Redis database.
- `SUDO_ADMINS`: IDs of your bot's admin users.

Don't forget to refer to the provided `.env.sample` for guidance on setting up these variables.
