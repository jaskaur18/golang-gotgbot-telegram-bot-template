# Telegram bot starter based for [Gotgbot](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars/gotgbot)

Please, enjoy this starter template for gotgbot Telegram bots based on [HoneySingh](t.me/ronnekeren). It includes most common middlewares, MongoDB integration, language picker and internationalization and shows basic encapsulation techniques used by me.

# Installation and local launch

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/jaskaurhello/telegram-bot-grammy-typescript-boilerplate`
2. Launch the [mongo database](https://www.mongodb.com/) locally
3. Create `.env` with the environment variables listed below
4. Run `go get -u .` in the root folder
5. Run `make dev`

And you should be good to go! Feel free to fork and submit pull requests. Thanks!

# Environment variables

- `BOT_TOKEN` — Telegram bot token
- `MONGO_URI` — URL of the mongo database
- `ADMIN_IDS` — Your Admins Ids

Also, please, consider looking at `.env.sample`.
